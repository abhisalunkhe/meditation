<h1> What information we gather from you</h1>
<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">A) Information Collected Through Times Services.</h1>

* <h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;"><b>Information You Voluntarily Give Us</b></h1><br>
For Registration:
When you sign up for a Times Service (e.g., a subscription), 
we collect your contact information and account credentials. 
Once you’re registered, we assign you a unique ID number. 
This ID number helps us recognize you when you’re signed in.

For some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your Apple, 
Facebook or Google account. 
See “From Other Sources” below.

If you register for an event or conference, we might ask for additional information 
(e.g., your company name, your job title or your dietary restrictions).

</p>
<p>
<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">For User-Generated Content:</h1></b>
We offer you the ability to post content that other users can read 
(e.g., comments or recipe reviews). Anyone can read, collect and use 
any personal information that accompanies your posts. See the Comments F.A.Q., 
or read “User-Generated Content” in our Terms of Service for more information.

We do not have to publish any of your content.
 If the law requires us to take down, remove or edit your personal information, 
 we will comply to the required extent.

<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">For Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers:</b></h1>
When you sign up for these, you give us your name, email 
and any other required information.

<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">For Reader Surveys, Research, Panels and Experience Programs:</b></h1>
We gather information through questionnaires, surveys and feedback programs. 
We also conduct similar research for advertisers. We ask you for your consent 
to use this information when you participate in these programs and events.

<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">During Contact With Our Call Centers:</b></h1>
We collect information from you when you place an order over the phone or 
contact customer service through one of our toll-free numbers.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;"><b>Personal Contacts Data:</b></h1>
We never scan your device for your contacts or upload that data.

With your consent, we do comply with your requests to collect data 
about your friends, family or acquaintances (e.g., Refer a Friend campaigns). 
This functionality is only meant for U.S. residents. By using it, 
you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the 
United States — and that you have everyone’s consent for us to use their contact information.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;"><b>Information Collected Automatically</b></h1>
With Tracking Technologies in Your Browser and Mobile Apps:
These technologies include cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts, 
software development kits (or SDKs) and beyond.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">What do we do With the information We collect about you.</h1>

<p>
<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">A) We provide the Times Services.</b></h1>

We use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services, such as:
<p style="border:solid 2px; width:90%;">
Making a Times Service available to you
Arranging access to your account
Providing customer service
Responding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints
Completing your payments and transactions
Sending service-related messages (e.g., a change in our terms and conditions)
Saving your reading list, recipes or property searches
Displaying your Crossword stats
Letting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys, panels, research and comments.
</p>
<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">B) We Personalize Your Experience.</b></h1>

We track your interests and reading habits (e.g., the articles you read) to personalize your reading 
experience using technology like algorithmic recommendations and machine learning. This is how we highlight 
articles you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles you’ve already read. For more information about 
content personalization on Times Services, you can read the Personalization F.A.Q. We also show you prices,
 promotions, products or services we believe you’ll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;"><b>C) We Allow You to Share User-Generated Content.</b></h1>

Any information you disclose in your content becomes public — along with your chosen screen name and uploaded photo.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;"><b>D) We Develop Products and Services, and Do Analysis.</b></h1>

We analyze data on our users’ subscription, purchase and usage behaviors. This helps us make business and marketing decisions.

For example, our analysis lets us predict preferences and price points for our products and services. 
It helps us determine whether our marketing is successful. It also shows us characteristics about our readers, 
which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.

Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use. You can find out how Google Analytics uses data and how to opt out of Google Analytics.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;"><b>E) We Carry Out Administrative Tasks.</b></h1>

For auditing: We verify that our internal processes work as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.
For fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities.
For customer satisfaction: We assess users’ satisfaction with Times Services and our customer care team.
The above activities can involve outside companies, agents or contractors (“service providers”) with whom we share your personal information for these purposes (discussed further below).

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;"><b>F) We Offer Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions.</b></h1>

You can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions. 
Some might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your personal information.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; background-color:skyblue;"><b>G)We Allow for Personalized Advertising on Times Services & Create Audiences for ThirdParty Advertisers.</b></h1>

We gather data and work with third parties to show you personalized ads on behalf of advertisers. 
This data comes from ad tracking technologies set by us or the third party (e.g., cookies), the information you provide 
(e.g., your email address), your use of Times Services (e.g., your reading history), information from advertisers or advertising vendors 
(e.g., demographic data) and anything inferred from any of this information. 
We only use or share this information in a manner that does not reveal your identity. 
For example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services. Google uses cookies or unique device identifiers, 
in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on you visiting nytimes.com and other sites. 
You can opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the related Google privacy policy.

We also identify groups of users to whom to serve personalized ads on behalf of our advertisers. 
To do this, we combine information we collect through surveys or registration with information 
we collect automatically using tracking technologies while you browse our sites and apps. 
This combined information is used to build models. These data models are then used to measure users’ attributes,
 like their demographic information or their interests. Working with service providers,
 we use these measurements to group users by common attributes. Each group is associated with
 a random ID which is then passed to our ad server for use in targeting ad campaigns on our sites and apps.

Another example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our guides and product recommendations.
 Times Services include links that will send you to vendor URLs and other services not operated or controlled by us.
 These vendors use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your navigation from the 
 Times Services to the merchant you are visiting. If you buy a product after following a link to a link vendor’s URL, we may earn a commission.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;"><b>Additional notes:</b></h1>

For more about targeted advertising, and how to opt out with your specific browser and device, 
go to the DAA Webchoices Browser Check and NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising. 
You can download the AppChoices app to opt out in mobile apps. You can also follow the instructions in the What Are Your Rights? section below.
We try to limit how our third-party advertising technology vendors use the information they gather from you.
 Many of these providers require us to enter into contracts that allow them to optimize their own services and products, or that help them create their own.

Essentially, these providers combine any information they gather about you through Times Services with information they receive from their other clients.
 This helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.
These third parties sometimes use other services in order to serve ads; check their privacy policies for more details.
 For further information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the applicable Cookie Policy.
<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:50%; background-color:skyblue;">H) We Advertise Times Services to You.</b></h1>

We market our properties to you. Sometimes we use marketing vendors to do this.

We serve ads through websites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties. 
Often these ads are targeted at people who have visited or registered for a Times Service but have not subscribed or purchased anything. 
The ads are also targeted at people with similar traits or behaviors to our subscribers or customers.

We target our advertising to these users by uploading an encrypted customer list to a third party,
 or by incorporating a tracking technology from a third party onto our Times Service. 
 The third party then matches individuals who appear in both our data and their data. 
 Because of how this matching process works, the third party can’t read our encrypted customer list if they don’t already have it.

To opt out of receiving these matched ads, contact the applicable third parties. 
For example, when we use “Custom Audience” to serve you our ad through Facebook,
 you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of that Facebook ad and opt out. 
 We are not responsible for any third party’s failure to comply with opt-out requests.

We periodically send you targeted email newsletters or promotional emails.
 For information on opting out of these emails, see What Are Your Rights?

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;"><b>I) We Aggregate (or De-identify) Personal Information Into Larger Findings.</b></h1>

Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no longer identify you, under applicable laws.
 This helps us better understand and represent our users, such as when we measure ad performance, create advertising interest-based segments or compile survey results.
 We can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">With whom Do we share your Information We Gather? </h1>
<p>

<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">A) With Service Providers:</b></h1>

We work with service providers, as defined above, to carry out certain tasks:
<b><i><pre>
<p style="border:solid 2px; width:50%;">
**Processing your payments
**Fulfilling your orders
**Maintaining technology and related infrastructure
**Offering you customer service
**Serving and targeting ads
**Measuring ad performance
**Presenting surveys
**Shipping you products and mailings
**Distributing emails
**List processing and analytics
**Managing and analyzing research
**Managing promotions</i></b></pre></p>
When performing these tasks, service providers often have access to your personal information.

We sometimes allow them to use aggregated or de-identified information for other purposes, in accordance with applicable laws

<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">B) With Other Third Parties:</b></h1>

There are situations when we share your information with third parties beyond our service providers. 
We never share your email address with these third parties without your consent, 
except in encrypted form to engage in the matched ads process described above.

If you’re a U.S. print subscriber, we may share your name and mailing address 
(among other information) with other reputable companies that want to market to you by mail.

We share information about our live event and conference attendees (e.g., your name, 
your company or your job title) with the event sponsors. In those cases we notify you when you provide us the information.

We share information about participants in our sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions with the promotions’ sponsors.
 In those cases we notify you when you provide us the information.

We process payments you make through Times Services with external services.

<b><h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">There are two ways this can happen:</b></h1>

We collect your information and share it with the third-party service for processing.
The third-party service collects your information for processing.
In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or 
other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), 
we would have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your information to a third party — such as an acquiring entity and its advisers.

We can preserve or share personal information if the law requires us to do so.
 We can also preserve or share personal information if we believe it would be necessary to:

Comply with the law or with legal process
Protect and defend our rights and property
Protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Times Services
Protect the safety or property of our users or the general public (
e.g., if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, 
we could share your information to help investigations into your actions)
Cooperate with government authorities, which could be outside your country of residence.
We disclose public activities in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. 
Your public activities could thus appear on other websites, blogs or feeds.</p>

<div>
<pre>
<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:50%; background-color:skyblue;"><i>What about sensitive Information</i></h1>
<p>We generally don’t want to gather any sensitive information about you. This includes:
<p style="border:solid 2px; width:50%;">
**Your social security number
**Your racial or ethnic origin
**Your political opinions
**Your religion or other beliefs
**Your health, biometric or genetic characteristics
**Any trade union membership
**Any criminal background<br>
</p>
There are rare situations when we request this information (e.g., a reader survey asks about your political leanings), but you can decline to answer. 
Outside those situations we would prefer you never share that information with us.</p>
</pre>
</div>
<div>
<pre>
<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">How do you protect My Information</h1>
<p>
We protect your personal information with a series of organizational, 
technological and physical safeguards — but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
 We recommend that you use complex and unique passwords for your Times accounts and for third-party accounts linked to them. 
 Do not share your password with anyone.

If you have reason to believe your interaction with us is no longer secure, notify us immediately.

<h1 style="border:solid 2px; width:90%; background-color:skyblue;">What about links To Third party Services?</h1>
<p>Some Times Services contain links to third-party websites, resources, vendors and advertisers. 
These third parties are not Times Services. We do not control (and are not responsible for) third party content or privacy practices.
 Any personal data you provide to them is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
